~Eternea vs. Thiyodin - for PixelSquid!~


This is an OST concept for a video game to be called Eternea: Seasons of Change


Welcome to a brave and wonderful dimension where Dragons, Tower-sized Owls and other Mythical creatures play about their lives, helping humans in the dream world. 
Suddenly in this dimension of Love and Peace, Eternea finds herself in a war. How will she fight for herself and her kin?

I Used Musescore and Reaper to compose and master, respectively. 'A Dragon's Oath' is the general theme of the video game, and would play while the credits roll. 
'Eternea vs. Thiyodin' is the boss battle toward the very end of the game, in which Eternea faces off against her usually indifferent foil/arch enemy, Thiyodin.

The game's Genre is RPG, and it is an emotional choice-based epic which ties Story-wise into many other games in the series. Ideally the game can run about 18 hours.
